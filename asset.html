                            The internet of things (IoT) connects physical machines and
                            equipment in a factory to the digital world of cloud, data
                            analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It enables you to

                            Forward-thinking manufacturers already know they need to bring
                            IT closer to operational technologies that control machines and
                            equipment. Traditionally, these technologies were managed by
                            separate departments in relative isolation. <br><br>Leaders, such as
                            food and beverage giant Lion, have merged the teams to create a
                            single integrated technology function to leverage synergies.

                            The next step is to harness technology to optimize the business and drive innovation.
                            Industry 4.0 advances in manufacturing are setting the standard for creating the
                            smart factory and supply chain of the future using industrial IoT (IIoT), analytics,

                                Companies can create new products and
                                services to generate additional revenue streams. Machines with IIoT
                                sensors can gather huge amounts of data, and advanced analytics
                                can transform it into “smart data” – that is, <br><br> digital information that is
                                formatted so that it can be acted upon at the collection point before

                                can be monetized. One of the most popular use cases is predictive
                                maintenance of factory assets. If the organization servicing the assets

                                IIoT can help make products and services
                                more attractive. IIoT-enabled parts, for example, are easier to find in a
                                warehouse when used in conjunction with an indoor navigation system
                                that can lead warehouse staff directly to their location. <br><br> A smart product

                                manufacturers, but today they are also being measured on corporate
